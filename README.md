# 💻 LaptopGPT

**LaptopGPT** is a web-based, conversational laptop recommendation system designed to help users find the ideal laptop based on their individual needs, preferences, and budget. The application mimics a chatbot-like interface, allowing users to describe their requirements in natural language (e.g., "I want a laptop for gaming under ₹70,000"), and then returns tailored recommendations using a rule-based engine.

Built with Python (Flask) for the backend and a clean HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend, LaptopGPT is modular and scalable, with plans to integrate advanced natural language processing via LangChain or Dialogflow, and machine learning models for personalized suggestions in the future.

Whether you're a student, gamer, or working professional, LaptopGPT simplifies the laptop-buying experience by turning specifications into simple conversations.
